# Regex Data Extractor

This Python script reads a text file and uses regular expressions to extract specific types of data.

## What It Does
It looks for and prints:

* Email Addresses
* URLs
* Phone Numbers
* HTML Tags
* Currency

## How to Use
1. Put your text in a file named "sample_data.txt"
2. Run the script:
3. See the extracted results in the terminal

## Note:
depending on what directory level you are in you may need to change the path. I used the absolute path to the file so you can access it at root level but if you are in the "alu_regex-data-extraction-AceArnold" directory you can use the relative path 
### relative path: sample_data.txt
### absolute path(path from root): alu_regex-data-extraction-AceArnold/sample_data.txt
